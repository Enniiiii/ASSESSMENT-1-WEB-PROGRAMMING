            <li>2 tsp of dried oregano</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          For the cheese itself
          <ul>
            <li>
              24-32 oz of whole mil, low moisture mozarella, freshly grated

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <!--Instructions on how to construct the pizza -->
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl and leave it for a few
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once it's foamy, proceed with adding olive oil, salt and 5 cups of
          bread flour.
        </li>
        <li>Mix until it is fully combined, then start kneading.</li>
        <li>
          Knead until you can stretch the dough without it tearing. Add flour to
          keep the dough not so sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the dough into four equal pieces and store in the fridge and
          let them rise from 2hrs to 7 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are going to need a pizza stone/steel and put that into the oven.
          Preheat the oven to the highest possible temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Mix all of the sauce ingredients in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Dust the pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour.</li>
        <li>
          Place the pizza dough onto the peel and stretch it as wide as
          possible, does not have to be a perfect circle.
        </li>
        <li>Coat the top of the dough with sauce.</li>
        <li>Dust the top with parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with mozarella cheese.</li>
        <li>
          Transfer the pizza into the oven and bake until the crust or cheese
          has been browned.
        </li>
      </ol>
