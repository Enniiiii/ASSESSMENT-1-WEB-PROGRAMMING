          <p>
            Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece. I don't say that often, in
            fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the
            amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense
            dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered
            subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best
            drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees
            potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band,
            at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character
            study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is
            about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential
            emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a
            drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection
            amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and
            how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect
            musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is
            difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to
            achieve this; the question is: "is there a line between gently
            pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon
            them?". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he
            actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will
            be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The
            internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his
            passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally
            unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed
            with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien
            Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the
            musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K
            Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance
            I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously,
            he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying
            innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash
            forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review. 10/10
